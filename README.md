# Husic <img src="/res/logo/logo.png" width="24"/>
This is the offical repo for the Husic project.
## What is this project?
This is a project to make what I deem to be the best music player, the plan is to start small and increase its reach by extending its usability and supported platforms, while staying open and free. There will be some freemium options for customisation as a thanks for people who donate, however it will still be possible to customise the player for accessbility reasons and by modifying the resource files, however for that knowledge of the used UI framework will be necessary\*.

The player will also act as an API, for both controlling it and for sending out data to truly make it open and customisable, and it will also allow for extensions.

\**This may change to be much easier in the future, as I don't yet have a concrete idea of how far I want to take this project.*
## Stage
This will show what stages will be present in this project (this will change as the project evoloves and progresses)

**Current stage**: Alpha

**Future stages:**
- Beta
- RC (release candidate)

## Current goals
- [ ] An MVP project created with .Net MAUI/WPF for basic playlists and playback, currently for Windows only.


## Licensing
As of right now no license has been included because the project is not meant to be modified or used at this stage, however once it reaches that point an appriopriate license will be added.
